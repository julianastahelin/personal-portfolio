<h1>Personal portfolio</h1>

<p>This is my personal portfolio as a front-end web developer, where I show my curriculum and some recent projects. </p>
<p>This project was first built with React and Styled Components. Then, a few months later, I needed to update the info on my tech stack and decided to refactor my entire portfolio applying some of my most recent learnings.</p>
<p> Now, it is built with Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, Contentlayer and Framer Motion. I used Git and <a href='https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/'>Conventional Commits</a> to keep track of the process and make it as organised as possible. </p>

<p>Hope you like it!</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>The project</h3>
<p>My portfolio has a home page where I present myself and other pages displaying my tech stack, projects, blog posts and curriculum. I made the whole content in two languages that can be picked on the navbar (portuguese and english). It is responsive to screen sizes from mobile to desktop.</p>
