            I am Juliana, a Frontend Web Developer. I have been developing projects with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Bootstrap, trying to write my code the best way possible and looking forward to letting them functional, readable and well organised. I am currently studying frontend and, soon, will be diving into backend development.
