title: About
text: I have a pharmacy degree and I am migrating my career to technology, diving deep into programming. Recently, I’ve found a great joy in writing about my learning on this area an sharing knowledge with the community. On my spare time I like to dance, play volleyball and run - I’ve recently completed a half-marathon! I love to travel, get to know new people and cultures and learn new languages. My dream is to travel around the world!
